# About
As per the Food Waste Index Report 2024 by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Indonesia ranks the highest in household food waste in Southeast Asia, amounting to 14.73 million tons per year. In response, we have developed an application aimed at reducing household food waste by maximizing the utilization of leftover ingredients. This application targets individuals with excess but still edible food ingredients, who struggle to find suitable recipes for them. Its key feature is a recipe search function tailored to users' available ingredients. 

# Features and Functionalities
-User authentication
Sign-up and login using email and password.
-Ingredients Management
Allow users to enter and delete ingredients.
-Recipe Display
Display a list of recipes that match the entered ingredients. 
-Recipe Details
View detailed information for each recipe, including ingredients and instructions.
-Favorite Recipe
Allow users to mark recipes as favorites.
-Search by Recipes Name
Allow users to search recipes by the name.
